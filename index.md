## Hello! 

I am Ritchie Ng, a machine learning engineer from the National University of Singapore (NUS) specializing in deep learning and computer vision. 

Currently, I am conducting research in the areas of deep learning and hyperparameter optimization in NUS. And I live in University Town, NUS, as a Global Merit Scholar. Feel free to drop me a message if you are ever around NUS, I've a lot of free meal credits to spare! 

I started this website to document my personal guides on machine learning. This website allows anyone to easily search for a guide I wrote. You can use the Google Search function to easily search for guides too. 

Oh yes! You can check out some of my "cool" stickman [comics](http://www.ritchieng.com/tag_comic_series/) on Machine Learning if you are looking to chillax with my stickman.

## Ongoing Applications

<br />**Search for code for research papers on arXiv.**
<br />This is basically "the Google" for searching code for computer science papers on arXiv. It's currently concentrated on deep learning and machine learning. I started this companion website to arXiv.org to encourage reproducible research. You can easily search for code that are implemented by the authors themselves or often by others.

## Projects

**Large Scale Identification of Multiple Digits from Real-world Images with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)**
<br />This project uses TensorFlow and TensorBoard extensively.
