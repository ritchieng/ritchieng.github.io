## Hello! 

I started this website to document my personal guides on machine learning. This website allows me to easily search for a guide I wrote. You can use the Google Search function to easily search for guides too. 

Oh yes! I am a budding machine learning engineer specializing in deep learning, reinforcement learning and artificial intelligence with images and videos. You can check out some of my "cool" [comics](http://www.ritchieng.com/tag_comic_series/) on Machine Learning if you are looking for something less technical.

## My Projects

**Large Scale Identification of Multiple Digits from Real-world Images with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)**
<br />This project uses TensorFlow and TensorBoard extensively.

<br />[Report](https://github.com/ritchieng/NumNum/blob/master/NumNum/report/report.pdf)

**Training a smart cab using Recurrent Learning**
<br />This project uses Python and PyGame to train a smart cab with Recurrent Learning.

## About My Professional Background
Before 2014, I started a company, [Tesglo](http://www.tesglo.com), specializing in materials science and grew it to become a GST-registered firm having an array of MNCs as our loyal clientele. It has been profitable every year and it funds my tech ventures.

In 2014, I joined Indo-Sing Business Advisory [(ISBA)](http://www.isbabiz.com/about/) and built their technological infrastructure. Subsequently, I went on to lead web development at [Moirai](http://www.moiraidesign.com), a high-end fashion firm where every single apparel is unique.

In 2015, I co-founded [Kinsheep](http://www.jfdi.asia/blog/jfdi-discover-helps-kinsheep-win-10k), a social networking application, using a full-stack Javascript framework including Ionic, NodeJS and MongoDB. My team shortly clinched the prestigious VaSCo grant from NUS School of Computing.

In 2016, I went on to become a full-stack Javascript web developer specializing in ReactJS, Meteor and MongoDB and built [reviw.me](https://www.reviw.me), a web application that allows people to review their financial consultants, and [PeerCapita](https://www.peercapita.com), specializing in connecting investors with collaterized loans.

Currently, I specialize in deep learning with images and videos!

## Personal Information
I am currently based in the National University of Singapore as a Global Merit Scholar. So feel free to drop me a message if you want some free meals (I have a lot of extra meal credits)!
