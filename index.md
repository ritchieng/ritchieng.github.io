## Website's Aim

To document my guides, notes and thoughts on machine learning for trading and public policy.

## About My Educational Background

I am a self-taught programmer specializing in machine learning for trading and public policy. 

You would come to realise that I do not have a computer science degree. But it does not stop anyone, including myself, from being competent in programming, statistics or mathematics in general.

Instead, I am currently an undergraduate majoring in Finance, and Economic and Policy Analysis under a concurrent degree programme: Bachelor in Business Administration (BBA) and Master in Public Policy (MPP), National University of Singapore (NUS).

Also, I am an NUS Global Merit Scholar where my school fees, college accommodation, overseas programmes and allowance are covered under the auspices of NUS. As a result, I got the opportunity to study in Bocconi University, Milan, Italy for 6 months and the University of Notre Dame, Indiana, USA for another 6 months in 2016! Check out my posts on my journey of studying in three continents.

## About My Professional Background
At age 12, I started a gaming business generating thousands in net profit per month. I closed it to pursue my studies.

At age 18, I started a company, Tesglo, specialising in materials science and grew it to become a GST-registered firm having an array of MNCs as our loyal clientele. It has been profitable every year and it funds my tech ventures.

At age 21, I joined Indo-Sing Business Advisory (ISBA) and built their technological infrastructure. I also worked with the Managing Director to lead debt restructuring and equity raising deals in India, Indonesia and Singapore for a year. I realised many areas in the investment banking sector can be automated and I have since dedicated my life to software engineering.

At age 22, I subsequently dived into tech start-ups and started Kinsheep. My team shortly  clinched the prestigious VaSCo grant from NUS School of Computing.

Currently, I specialize in machine learning for trading and public policy.

## Location
I am currently based in a sunny island called Singapore.
