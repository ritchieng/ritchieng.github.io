## Hello! 

I am Ritchie Ng, a machine learning engineer from the National University of Singapore (NUS) specializing in deep learning and computer vision. 

Currently, I am conducting research in the areas of deep learning and hyperparameter optimization in NUS. And I live in University Town, NUS, as a Global Merit Scholar. Feel free to drop me a message if you are ever around NUS, I've a lot of free meal credits to spare! 

I started this website to document my personal guides on machine learning. This website allows anyone to easily search for a guide I wrote. You can use the Google Search function to easily search for guides too. 

Oh yes! You can check out some of my "cool" stickman [comics](http://www.ritchieng.com/tag_comic_series/) on Machine Learning if you are looking to chillax with my stickman.

## Ongoing Projects
**[Gloqo](https://www.gloqo.com)**
<br />This is basically "the Google" for searching code for computer science papers on arXiv. It's currently concentrated on deep learning and machine learning. I started this companion website to arXiv.org to encourage reproducible research. You can easily search for code that are implemented by the authors themselves or often by others.

**[TensorFlow AWS AMI, TFAMI](https://github.com/ritchieng/tensorflow-aws-ami)**
<br /> This is an open-source and actively-maintained Amazon Web Service AMI that allows anyone to work with Python, TensorFlow, Keras, TensorLayer, CUDA, cuDNN, and OpenAI Gym within 5 minutes.

## Past Projects

**[Large Scale Identification of Multiple Digits from Real-world Images with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)](https://github.com/ritchieng/NumNum)**
<br />This project uses Python, TensorFlow, TensorBoard and OpenCV.

**[Training a Smart Cab using Reinforcement Learning](http://www.ritchieng.com/machine-learning-proj-smart-cab/)**
<br />This project uses Python and PyGame to train a smart cab with reinforcement learning.

**[Identifying Customer Segments (Unsupervised Learning)](http://www.ritchieng.com/machine-learning-project-customer-segments/)**
<br />This project uses Python and Scikit-learn with an emphasis on PCA and clustering.

**[Building a Student Intervention System (Supervised Learning)](http://www.ritchieng.com/machine-learning-project-student-intervention/)**
<br />This project uses Python and Scikit-learn with an emphasis on Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression and Support Vector Machines.

**[Predicting Boston House Prices](http://www.ritchieng.com/machine-learning-project-boston-home-prices/)** 
<br />This project uses Python and Scikit-learn with an emphasis on learning curves, complexity curves, GridSearchCV and RandomizedSearchCV.
