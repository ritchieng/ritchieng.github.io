## Hello! 
I am Ritchie Ng, and I am currently conducting research in deep learning, computer vision and natural language processing in NExT Search Centre led by [Professor Tat-Seng Chua](http://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~chuats/) that is jointly setup between National University of Singapore (NUS) and Tsinghua University and is part of [NUS Smart Systems Institute](http://ssi.nus.edu.sg/#homepage). 

Currently I live in University Town, NUS, as a Global Merit Scholar. Feel free to drop me a message if you are ever around NUS, I have a lot of free meal credits to spare! 

Oh yes! You can check out some of my stickman [comics](http://www.ritchieng.com/tag_comic_series/) on Machine Learning.

## The Purpose of Artificial Intelligence
John Keynes predicted we would only work 15 hours a week. Yup, you heard it! I believe we can do that with even fewer stupendously productive hours. We can then spend the rest of our time doing other awesome things like [Black Water Rafting](http://www.waitomo.com/black-water-rafting/Pages/default.aspx). I bet you have never heard of that.

We can and will reach there by improving machine intelligence that can directly and indirectly improve people's lives.

## Papers

## Deep Learning Courses
I am the lead instructor for all courses on Deep Learning Wizard.
<br />[Main Course Website, Deep Learning Wizard](https://www.deeplearningwizard.com/)
<br />[Practical Deep Learning with PyTorch, Deep Learning Wizard](https://www.udemy.com/practical-deep-learning-with-pytorch/?couponCode=DEEPWIZARD)

## Past Talks
[Deep Learning for Self-Driving Cars and Medical Diagnostics, NVIDIA, Singapore](http://www.ritchieng.com/events/deep-learning-self-driving-cars-medical-nvidia)

## Active Projects
**[Gloqo](https://www.gloqo.com)**
<br /> This is basically "the Google" for searching code for computer science papers on arXiv. It's currently concentrated on deep learning and machine learning. I started this companion website to arXiv.org to encourage reproducible research. You can easily search for code that are implemented by the authors themselves or often by others.

**[The Incredible PyTorch](https://github.com/ritchieng/the-incredible-pytorch)**
<br /> This is an awesome curated list of tutorials, papers, projects, communities and more relating to PyTorch.

**[DLAMI](https://github.com/ritchieng/dlami)**
<br /> A Deep Learning Amazon Web Service (AWS) AMI that is open, free and works. Run any deep learning framework in less than 5 minutes including TensorFlow, Keras, PyTorch, Theano, MXNet, CNTK, Torch, and Caffe.

## Past Projects
**[Residual Networks with TensorFlow](https://github.com/ritchieng/resnet-tensorflow)**

**[Wide Residual Networks with TensorFlow](https://github.com/ritchieng/wideresnet-tensorlayer)**

**[Large Scale Identification of Multiple Digits from Real-world Images with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)](https://github.com/ritchieng/NumNum)**

**[Training a Smart Cab (Reinforcement Learning)](http://www.ritchieng.com/machine-learning-proj-smart-cab/)**

**[Identifying Customer Segments (Unsupervised Learning)](http://www.ritchieng.com/machine-learning-project-customer-segments/)**

**[Building a Student Intervention System (Supervised Learning)](http://www.ritchieng.com/machine-learning-project-student-intervention/)**

**[Predicting Boston House Prices](http://www.ritchieng.com/machine-learning-project-boston-home-prices/)** 

## Past Articles

## Awards

**Global Merit Scholarship 2014-2018, NUS**
<br /> NUS top scholarship with only 4 awarded in NUS across all faculties for the year of my admission.
<br /> Full scholarship amounting to more than $100,000 covering tuition, allowance, accommodation, overseas trips and meals.

**Dean's List 2015/2016, NUS**
<br /> Top 5% of my cohort.

**I&E Practicum Award 2017, NUS**
<br /> $10,000 Award
