## Machine Learning with scikit-learn with Data School
 
This is a free course offered by Data School. 
- [Machine Learning with scikit-learn](http://www.dataschool.io/machine-learning-with-scikit-learn/)
- [Introduction to Pandas](http://www.dataschool.io/easier-data-analysis-with-pandas/)


## Review
The course is good for people who have completed Andrew Ng's class on Machine Learning. You would start to realise how scikit-learn automates a lot of the low-level Octave code you implemented in Andrew Ng's class from the simple gradient descent algorithm, to regularization, and the mind-boggling neural networks. Although I will be writing more on Neural Networks using Tensorflow (formerly known as Skflow).

Also, the tutorials offered by Data School are good for people who are new to scikit-learn and Python in general. If you do not want to watch his free open-source videos, you can check out my notes on all his tutorials.

Hope you enjoyed the notes I have derived from Data School! They are some variations on Github by others so feel free to use them too if you feel their explanations are clearer. 

I will be moving on to Udacity's Machine Learning nanodegree along with other online resources where I will document my progress. You can view my personal list on how to be a Machine Learning Engineer [here](http://www.ritchieng.com/machine-learning-resources/)

All the best!
