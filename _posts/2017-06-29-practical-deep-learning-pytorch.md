I have launched a course on deep learning with PyTorch that gets you starting with the PyTorch framework as well as understanding the transition from PyTorch fundamentals all the way to more complicated deep learning models. Sign up here: [https://www.udemy.com/practical-deep-learning-with-pytorch/](https://www.udemy.com/practical-deep-learning-with-pytorch/)!

The course is specifically designed such that if you are interested in diving deeper into the concepts and mathematics, you would be able to transition gradually with our upcoming courses in a series specializing in deep learning with PyTorch. It is also designed for anyone who wants to learn deep learning or are familiar with other frameworks and wish to use a framework that puts Python first.
