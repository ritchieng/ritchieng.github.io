As you know that through my website and my deep learning courses ([Deep Learning Wizard](https://www.deeplearningwizard.com/)), I have been vigorously pushing for making deep learning more accessible to everyone.

And I am thankful to announce that NVIDIA has given me the opportunity to be an NVIDIA Deep Learning Institute (DLI) instructor and ambassador in NUS to enable everyone to solve the most challenging problems in deep learning.

Cheers,
Ritchie
